# The Chair Game
Hello spooky fellow and welcome to `The Chair Game` where you will have to find a seat before everyone else does, or else you will be kicked off the Manor of Spokiness for the __ETERNITY__

The game was developed as final project for the `Interactive Graphics` course held by professor `Marco Schaerf` during July 2020.

## Play the game
Before taking your favourite seat, you may want to inspect for a moment these instructions:

* Use the menu in the upper-right region of the screen in order to select the number of foes and the difficulty level, then press `Start Game` in order to begin the first game phase. __Dont worry if you dont see the chairs... they will soon arrive!__.
* You can move your skeleton by using `WASD` keys.
* Once the chair spawns, quickly rush towards one of the chairs! If your skeleton succesfully captures a chair, he will start dancing.
* Once all chairs are occupied, one skeleton (hopefully not you) will die, one chair will be removed and a new match begins... The game ends when only one skeleton (hopefully you) survives.

You can test the current build of the game [here](https://sapienzainteractivegraphicscourse.github.io/final-project-eg-t/)
